# A template in Godot 4 for game jams

An empty template with the most common (and boring) things already setup:

* A main menu
* Localization

TODO
* Options menu with volume slides, full screen toggle and language selection
* Credits screen
* Level transitions
* Music handling (fade outs and ins after scene change)
* Basic automatic level load (so more levels can be added dynamically)
* Defeat/Win screen
* Pause menu
* Icons
... (more to come!)
